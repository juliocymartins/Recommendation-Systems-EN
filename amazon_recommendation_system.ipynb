    "Welcome to the Amazon Recommendation System project! This project is about the development of a recommendation system utilizing Cosine Similarity, which was applied to tags generated from review and product columns within the Amazon Sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including stop words removal, stemming, and count vectorization, to enhance its utility. Amazon is a prominent American multinational technology company recognized worldwide for its extensive e-commerce platform.\n",

    "- Cosine similarity is a measure that quantifies the similarity between two numerical vectors, often used in natural language processing and recommendation tasks. It measures the cosine of the angle between the two vectors and ranges from -1 (completely different) to 1 (identical), with 0 indicating that the vectors are orthogonal (unrelated). In text processing contexts, vectors typically represent word frequencies in documents. Cosine similarity is useful for finding similar documents or calculating the proximity between words based on their occurrence context."
