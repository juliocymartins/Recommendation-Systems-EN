# Recommendation Systems
Two recommendation systems were developed here: one for Disney Plus and another for Amazon. Both employ cosine similarity to provide personalized suggestions to users. The Disney Plus system recommends movies based on user preferences, while the Amazon system recommends products based on review analyses and product data.

# Amazon Recommendation System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Amazon Recommendation System project! This project is about the development of a recommendation system utilizing Cosine Similarity, which was applied to tags generated from review and product columns within the Amazon Sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including stop words removal, stemming, and count vectorization, to enhance its utility. Amazon is a prominent American multinational technology company recognized worldwide for its extensive e-commerce platform.
